# Twitter Snowflake ID Generator

This project is a demonstration of the Twitter Snowflake ID generator. It showcases how unique, time-ordered 64-bit IDs can be generated using the Snowflake algorithm. The Snowflake algorithm is widely used for distributed systems requiring unique identifiers at scale.

## Features

- **Unique 64-bit IDs**: Generates IDs that are globally unique and sortable based on time.
- **High Performance**: Designed to handle high-throughput ID generation with minimal latency.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for distributed systems, ensuring no collisions across nodes.

## How It Works

The Snowflake algorithm generates IDs based on the following components:

1. **Timestamp**: Ensures IDs are time-ordered.
2. **Machine ID**: Differentiates IDs generated by different nodes.
3. **Sequence Number**: Prevents collisions within the same millisecond.

## ID Structure

The generated 64-bit ID is composed of the following components:

| Bits | Component       | Description                                            |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 41   | Timestamp       | Milliseconds since the custom epoch.                   |
| 10   | Machine ID      | Unique identifier for the machine or instance.         |
| 12   | Sequence Number | Counter for IDs generated within the same millisecond. |

## How It Works

1. **Timestamp**: The current time in milliseconds since the custom epoch is calculated.
2. **Machine ID**: A unique machine ID is assigned, either manually or derived from the MAC address.
3. **Sequence Number**: A counter that increments for each ID generated within the same millisecond. It wraps around to `0` when it exceeds `4095`.

The final ID is constructed by combining these components using bitwise operations.

## Usage

To use this demo, clone the repository and follow the instructions provided in the code. The implementation is straightforward and serves as a learning tool for understanding the Snowflake algorithm.
